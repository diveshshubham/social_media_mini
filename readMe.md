# mini cab booking platform

## Assumptions
- let assume that when user searches for driver the driver automatically gets notification with some service.
- let's assume the points are geo location co-ordinates so, we can use different formula to calculate distance
- we only allow email to sign in
- there is only one type of vehicle so, we have not included any vehicle detils


## How to Start

- install the pacakages and dependencies by running npm install --save
-make sure you have mongo installed on mongo
- make and .env file and write your credentials there as per the sample_env.txt file
- after installation of npm pacakages run the command npm start or nodemon server.js in the default project directory
